About the Project:

In this project, I utilized the OpenGL API for C/C++ to create a simple 3D scene of a kitchen island and various other vertex based objects, like a coffee mug and a dinner plate. It involved creating custom shaders and lighting effects as well as implementing dynamic vertex based objects that allowed the user to traverse through the scene via their keyboard through integrating a camera into the project.
